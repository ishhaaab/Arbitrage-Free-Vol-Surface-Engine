# Known Issues

## 1. `_check_butterfly` — `minimize_scalar(bounded)` can miss violations near SVI spike

**File:** `src/arbfree_vol/arbitrage/svi_detect.py:_check_butterfly`

**Problem:**
`minimize_scalar(method='bounded')` is a local optimizer. When `g(k)` has a sharp spike (e.g. at `k = m` where `g` shoots to +300+), Brent's bracket gets trapped and returns a boundary point, completely missing violations on the other side of the spike.

**Example params that trigger this:**
```python
SVIParams(a=0.04, b=0.9, rho=0.97, m=2.0, sigma=0.01)
```
- `g(k)` is positive everywhere in `[-2, 2]`
- `g(k)` has a huge spike (+323) at `k = 2.0`
- `g(k)` goes negative at `k ≈ 2.7` (inside `[-3, 3]`)
- `minimize_scalar(bounded)` returns `k = -3.0, g ≈ +0.59` — misses the violation

**Fix (when ready):**
Replace the bare `minimize_scalar` call with a **coarse grid scan + local refinement** approach:
1. Evaluate `g(k)` on a coarse grid (e.g. 121 points over `[k_min, k_max]`).
2. Find the grid point with minimum `g`.
3. Refine locally with `minimize_scalar(bounded)` in a narrow bracket (±3 grid spacings) around that point.

121 extra `svi_g` evaluations is negligible cost. The function signature and output contract do not change.

**Status:** Known, documented. Test `test_butterfly_violation_outside_prev_range` currently fails because of this.
